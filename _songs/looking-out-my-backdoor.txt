[C]Just got home from Illinois, [Am]lock the front door, oh boy!
[F]Got to sit [C]down, take a [G]rest on the porch.
[C]Imagination sets in, [Am]pretty soon I'm singing,
[F]Doo, doo, [C]doo, Looking [G]out my back [C]door

[C]There's a giant doing cartwheels
A [Am]statue wearing high heels
[F]Look at all the [C]happy creatures [G]dancing on the lawn
A [C]dinosaur Victrola [Am]listening to Buck Owens
[F]Doo, doo, [C]doo, Looking [G]out my back [C]door

[G]Tambourines and elephants are [F]playing in the [C]band
Won't you [Am]take a ride on the flying [G]spoon? Doo, doo doo
[C]Wond'rous apparition [Am]provided by magician.
[F]Doo, doo, [C]doo, Looking [G]out my back [C]door

[G]Tambourines and elephants are [F]playing in the [C]band
Won't you [Am]take a ride on the flying [G]spoon? Doo, doo doo
[C]Bother me tomorrow, [Am]today, I'll buy no sorrows
[F]Doo, doo, [C]doo, Looking [G]out my back [C]door

[C]Forward troubles Illinois, [Am]lock the front door, oh boy!
[F]Look at all the [C]happy creatures [G]dancing on the lawn
[C]Bother me tomorrow, [Am]today, I'll buy no sorrows
[F]Doo, doo, [C]doo, Looking [G]out my back [C]door
