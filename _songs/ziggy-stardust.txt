[G](i[D]nt[Cadd9]ro x2)[G/B]    [G/A]   

[G] Now Ziggy played guitar,
[Bm]  Jamming good with Weird and [C]Gilly,
And the Spi[B]ders [C]from [D]Mars.
He played it left hand,[G] 
But made it too far.[Em]  
Became the spec[A]ial man,
Then we were [C]Ziggy's band.

[G]Ziggy really sang,
[Bm]screwed up eyes and screwed down [C]hairdo,
like some cat [B]from [C]Ja[D]pan.
He could lick 'em by smili[G]ng,
he could leave them to h[Em]ang.
They came on so [A]loaded, man,
well hung, [C]snow white tan....

[Am]  So w[G5]here were the sp[F5]iders,[G5]   [Am]  
While the [G5]fly tried to break[F5] our balls?[G5]   [Am]  
Just the bee[G5]r light to gu[F5]ide us,
 so  [G5]we [D]bitched about his [Dsus2]fans 
[D]and should we [E]crush his sweet hands?

[G](i[D]nt[Cadd9]erlude[G/B] x2)[G/A]   

[G]Ziggy played for time,
[Bm]Jiving us that we were voo[C]doo.
The kids [B]were [C]just [D]crass,
He was the [G]nazz,
With God given [Em]ass.
He took it [A]all too far,
But, boy, Could he [C]play guitar!

Making love to his ego,
Ziggy sucked up into his mind,
Like a leper Messiah,
When the kids had killed the man
I had to break up the band!

[G]Yeah[D]..[Cadd9].     [G/B]    [G/A]ooo....[G]  [D] 
[Cadd9]ZIGGY PLAYED GUI[G]TAR!
