The [Em]snow glows white on the [C]mountain tonight
Not a [D]footprint to be [Asus4]seen    [Am]  
A [Em]kingdom of iso[C]lation
And it [D]looks like I'm the [Asus4]queen    [A] 
The wind is ho[Em]wling like t[C]his swirling storm[D] inside        [Asus4]         [Am]  
[Em]Couldn't keep it [D]in, heaven knows I've [A]tried

[D]Don't let them in, don't let them [C]see
Be the good girl you always have to [D]be
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them [C]know
Well, now they [Cadd2]know 

Let it [G]go, let it [Dsus4/F#]go      
Can't [Em7]hold it back any[Cadd9]more 
Let it go,[G] let it go [Dsus4/F#]        
Turn a[Em7]way and slam the [Cadd9]door 
[G]I don't [Dsus4/F#]care what they're [Em7]going to [Cadd9]say  
Let the [Bm7]storm rage o[Bb]n 
The [C]cold never bothered me anyway

[G]    [Dsus4/F#]        

It'[Em]s funny how some dista[C]nce makes every[D]thing seem small[Am]  
And the [Em]fears that once [D]controlled me can't [Asus4]get to me at a[A]ll

[D]It's time to see what I can d[Cadd9]o    
To test the limits and break [D]through
No right, no wrong, no rules for [Cadd9]me   
I'm [Cadd2]free 

Let it [G]go, let it [Dsus4/F#]go      
I am o[Em7]ne with the wind[Cadd9] and sky
Let it go,[G] let it go [Dsus4/F#]        
You'll[Em7] never see me cry[Cadd9]     
[G]Here I s[Dsus4/F#]tand and here I'll[Em7] stay    [Cadd9]     
Let the [Bm7]storm rage o[Bb]n       [C] 

[C]My power flurries through the air into the ground
[C]My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
[D]And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
[Em]I'm never [C]going back, the[D] past is in the [Am]past   [C] 

Let it [G]go, let it [Dsus4/F#]go      
And I'[Em7]ll rise like the[Cadd9] break of dawn
Let it go,[G] let it go [Dsus4/F#]        
That p[Em7]erfect girl is go[Cadd9]ne   
[G]Here I [Dsus4/F#]stand in the [Em7]light of [Cadd9]day      [Cm]  
Let the [Bm7]storm rage o[Bb]n       [C] 
The [C]cold never bothered me anyway
