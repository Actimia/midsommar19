[A]Can you hear the drums Fernando?
I remember long ago another starry night like [F#m]this
In the firelight Fer[Bm]nando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your gui[E]tar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from a[A]far

There was something in the air that [E]night
The stars were bright, Fer[A]nando
They were shining there for [E]you and me
For liberty, Fer[A]nando
Though I never thought that we could [F#]lose
There s no re[B7]gret
If I had to do the [E]same again
I would, my friend, Fer[A]nando
If I had to do the [E]same again
I would, my friend, Fer[A]nando

[A]They were closer now Fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last et[F#m]ernally
I was so afraid Fe[Bm]rnando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to [E]die
And I m not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me [A]cry

There was something in the air that [E]night
The stars were bright, Fer[A]nando
They were shining there for [E]you and me
For liberty, Fer[A]nando
Though I never thought that we could [F#]lose
There s no re[B7]gret
If I had to do the [E]same again
I would, my friend, Fer[A]nando
If I had to do the [E]same again
I would, my friend, Fer[A]nando

Now we're old and grey Fernando
And since many years I haven t seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums Fernando?
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

There was something in the air that [E]night
The stars were bright, Fer[A]nando
They were shining there for [E]you and me
For liberty, Fer[A]nando
Though I never thought that we could [F#]lose
There s no re[B7]gret
If I had to do the [E]same again
I would, my friend, Fer[A]nando
If I had to do the [E]same again
I would, my friend, Fer[A]nando  2x
