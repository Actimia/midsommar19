[Em]No one knows what it's [G]like
To be a [D]bad man, to be a [C]sad man
[A]Behind blue eyes

[Em]No one knows what it's [G]like
To be [D]hated, to be [C]fated
To [A]telling only lies

But my [C]dream[D]s they aren't as [G]empty
As my [C]conscience [D]seems to [E]be
I have [Bm]hours, only l[C]onely
My love is [D]vengeance, that's never [A]free

[Em]No one knows what it's [G]like
To feel these [D]feelings, like I [C]do
And I blame [A]you
[Em]No one bites back as [G]hard
On their [D]anger, none of my [C]pain and woe
Could show [A]through

But my [C]dream[D]s they aren't as [G]empty
As my [C]conscience [D]seems to [E]be
I have [Bm]hours,  only l[C]onely
My love is [D]vengeance that's never [A]free

[E]When my [B]fist get clinches,[A]cracked it [E]open
Before I [B]use it and [G]lose my [D]cool
[E]When I [B]smile, please [A]tell me [D]some bad news
Before I [B]laugh and [A]act like a [E]fool

If I [B]swallow [A]anything [E]evil
Put your [B]finger [G]down my [D]throat
[E]If I [B]shiver, please [A]give me a [D]blanket
Keep me [B]warm, let me [A]wear your [E]coat

[Em]No one knows what it's [G]like
To be the [D]bad man, to be the [C]sad man
[A]Behind blue eyes
