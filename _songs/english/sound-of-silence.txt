[Am]Hello darkness, my old fr[G]iend,
I've come to talk with you [Am]again,
Because a vision s[F]oftly [C]creeping,
Left its [Am]seeds while I w[F]as sle[C]eping,
And the v[F]ision that was planted in my bra[C]in
Still r[Am]emains
Within the so[G]und of s[Am]ilence.

I[Am]n restless dreams I walked a[G]lone
Narrow streets of cobble[Am]stone,
'[Am]Neath the halo of a[F] street l[C]amp,
I turned my co[Am]llar to the c[F]old and d[C]amp
When my [F]eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon l[C]ight
That split the [Am]night
And touched the [G]sound of [Am]silence.

[Am]And in the naked light I sa[G]w
Ten thousand people, maybe [Am]more.
[Am]People talking wit[F]hout spe[C]aking,
[Am]People hearing without[F] listeni[C]ng,
People writing so[F]ngs that voices never sh[C]are
And no one [Am]dare
Disturb the s[G]ound of s[Am]ilence.

[Am]Fools said I, you do not kn[G]ow
Silence like a cancer [Am]grows.
[Am]Hear my words that I mi[F]ght teach y[C]ou,
[Am]Take my arms that I mi[F]ght reach yo[C]u.
But my wo[F]rds like silent raindrops f[C]ell,
And ec[Am]hoed
In the [G]wells of [Am]silence

[Am]And the people bowed and p[G]rayed
To the neon God they [Am]made.
[Am] And the sign flashed out i[F]ts warn[C]ing,
[Am]In the words that it wa[F]s form[C]ing.
And the s[Am]ign said, the wo[F]rds of the prophets
Are writ[F]ten on the subway wal[C]ls
And tenement ha[Am]lls.
And whispered in the s[G]ounds of s[Am]ilence.
