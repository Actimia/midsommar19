[D](i[G]nt[D]ro[A])

[D]You who are on the [G]road
Must have a [D]code that you can [A]live by[Asus4]      [A] 
And [D]so become your[G]self
Because the [D]past is just a [A]good-by[Asus4]e.    [A] 

[D]Teach your children [G]well,
Their father's [D]hell did slowly [A]go by[Asus4],     [A] 
And [D]feed them on your [G]dreams
The one they [D]pick's the one you'll [A]know b[Asus4]y.    [A] 

[D]Don't you ever ask them [G]why, if they told you, you will [D]cry,
So just look at them and [Bm]sig[G]h
[A]and know they [D]love you[G]. [D]  [A] 

And [D]you, of tender [G]years,
Can't know the [D]fears that your elders [A]grew b[Asus4]y,    [A] 
And so [D]please help them with your [G]youth,
They seek the [D]truth before they [A]can die[Asus4].     [A] 

[D]Teach your parents [G]well,
Their children's [D]hell will slowly [A]go by[Asus4],     [A] 
And [D]feed them on your [G]dreams
The one they [D]picks's the one you'll[A] know b[Asus4]y.    [A] 

[D]Don't you ever ask them [G]why, if they told you, you will [D]cry,
So just look at them and [Bm]sig[G]h
[A]and know they [D]love you[G]. [D]  [A]
