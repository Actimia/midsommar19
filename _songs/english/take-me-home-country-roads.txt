Almost [G]heaven, [Em]West Virginia,
[D]Blue Ridge Mountains, [C]Shenandoah [G]River.
[G]Life is old there, [Em]older than the trees,
[D]Younger than the mountains [C]growin' like a br[G]eeze

Country [G]Roads, take me [D]home
To the [Em]place I b[C]elong:
West Vir[G]ginia, mountain [D]momma,
Take me [C]home, Country [G]Roads.

[G]All my mem'ries g[Em]ather 'round her,
[D]Miner's lady, st[C]ranger to blue wate[G]r.
[G]Dark and dusty, pai[Em]nted on the sky,
[D]Misty taste of mo[C]onshine, teardrop in my[G] eye.

Country [G]Roads, take me [D]home
To the [Em]place I b[C]elong:
West Vir[G]ginia, mountain [D]momma,
Take me [C]home, Country [G]Roads.

[Em]I hear her [D]voice, in the [G]mornin' hours she calls me,
The [C]radio re[G]minds me of my [D]home far away,
And [Em]drivin' down the [F]road
I get a [C]feelin' that I [G]should have been home [D]yesterday, yester[D7]day.

Country [G]Roads, take me [D]home
To the [Em]place I b[C]elong:
West Vir[G]ginia, mountain [D]momma,
Take me [C]home, Country [G]Roads.

Take me [D]home, Country [G]Roads,
Take me [D]home, Country [G]Roads.
