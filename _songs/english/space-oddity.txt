[Am] Take your [Am7/G]protein pills and [D7/F#]put your helmet on

 [C]This is ground control to Major [E7]Tom, you've really made the [F]grade
 And the [Fm]papers want to [C]know whose shirts you [F]wear
 Now it's [Fm]time to leave the [C]capsule if you [F]dare

 [C]This is Major Tom to ground con[E7]trol, I'm stepping through the [F]door
 And I'm [Fm]floating in a [C]most peculiar [F]way
 And the [Fm]stars look very [C]different to[F]day

Tell my [Fm]wife I love her [C]very much, she [F]knows
[G]Ground control to Major Tom, your [Am]circuits dead, there's [Am7/C]something wrong
Can you [D7]hear me, Major Tom?

[Bbmaj7]Planet Earth is [Am9]blue and there's [G]nothing I can [F]do
