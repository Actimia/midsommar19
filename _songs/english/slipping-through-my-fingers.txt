[G]Schoolbag in han[Gm]d 
She leaves h[D]ome in the e[F#m]arly morning
[G]Waving g[Gm]oodbye
With an [D]absent-minded sm[F#m]ile
[G]I watch her [Gm]go
With a s[D]urge of that wel[F#m]l-known sadness
[G]And I have to si[A]t down for a whi[D]le

The [G]feeling that I'm [A/C#]losing her for[D]ever    [F#]  
And [G]without really [A]entering her [D]world    [D/F#]    
I'm [G]glad whenever I[A/C#] can share her [D]laughter, that [Asus4]funny little g[Dsus4]irl     [D] 

Slipping through my fi[G]ngers all the [D]time
I try to c[F#m]apture every m[Em]inute
The f[G]eeling i[D]n it
Slipping through my f[Asus4]ingers [A]all the [D]time
Do I really s[G]ee what's in her [D]mind
Each time I [F#m]think I'm close to k[Em]nowing
She ke[G]eps on gr[D]owing
Slipping through my fi[Asus4]ngers a[A]ll the [D]time

[G]Sleep in our eye[Gm]s 
Her and [D]me at th[F#m]e breakfast table
[G]Barely a[Gm]wake
[D]I let precious time [F#m]go by
[G]Then when she's [Gm]gone
There's that o[D]dd melanc[F#m]holy feeling
[G]And a sense of g[A]uilt I can't d[D]eny

What hap[G]pened to the w[A/C#]onderful ad[D]ventures[F#]  
The plac[G]es I had [A]planned for us to [D]go [D/F#](slipping through my fingers all the time)
[G]Well some of that we [A/C#]did 
But most we d[D]idn't
And[Asus4] why I just don't [Dsus4]know    [D] 

Slipping through my fi[G]ngers all the [D]time
I try to c[F#m]apture every m[Em]inute
The f[G]eeling i[D]n it
Slipping through my f[Asus4]ingers [A]all the [D]time
Do I really s[G]ee what's in her [D]mind
Each time I [F#m]think I'm close to k[Em]nowing
She ke[G]eps on gr[D]owing
Slipping through my fi[Asus4]ngers a[A]ll the [D]time

[G]Sometimes I wish that I[A] could freeze the p[D]icture  [F#]  
[G]And save it from the f[A]unny tricks of t[D]ime
Sl[D/F#]ipping through my f[G]inge[A]rs [D] 

[G]  [D]  [F#m]    [Em]   [G]  [D]  [Asus4]      [A]  [D] 
[G]  [D]  [F#m]    [Em]   [G]  [D] Slipping through my [Asus4]fingers all the [D]time

[G]Schoolbag in h[Gm]and
She leaves h[D]ome in the [F#m]early morning
[G]Waving g[Gm]oodbye with an a[D]bsent-minded [F#m]smile
