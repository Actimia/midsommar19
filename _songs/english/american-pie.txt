A [G]long, [D]long [Em7]time ago,
[Am]I can still re[C]member how that mus[Em]ic used to make me s[D]mile
And [G]I know [D]if I [Em7]had my chance,
That [Am]I could make those [C]people dance and [Em]maybe they'd be [C]happy for a w[D]hile
But [Em]February [Am]made me shiver, [Em]with every paper I'[Am]d deliver
[C]Bad news [G]on the [Am]doorstep, I cou[C]ldn't take one more st[D]ep
I [G]can't remem[D]ber if I [Em]cried when I [Am7]read about his [D]widowed bride
[G]Something [D]touched me [Em]deep inside
The [C]day the[D7] music d[G]ied

So [G]bye, [C]bye Miss [G]American [D]Pie
Drove my [G]Chevy to the [C]levy but the [G]levy was [D]dry
And them [G]good old [C]boys were drinkin' [G]whiskey and [D]rye
Singin' [Em*]this will be the day that I [A7*]die, t[Em*]his will be the day that I d[D7]ie

[G]Did you write the [Am]book of love
And do [C]you have faith in [Am]god above, [Em]if the bible [D]tells you so?
[G]Do you [D/F#]believe in r[Em]ock and roll
Can [Am7]music save your[C] mortal soul and can y[Em]ou teach me how to dance[A7] real slow[D]?
Well I [Em*]know that you're in l[D*]ove with him  'cuz I s[Em*]aw you dancin' i[D*]n the gym
You [C]both kicked [G]off your [A7]shoes, man I [C]dig those rhythm and [D7]blues
I was a [G]lonely [D/F#]teenage b[Em]roncin' buck with a p[Am]ink carnation and a p[C]ickup truck
But [G]I knew[D/F#] I was o[Em]ut of luck the d[C]ay the m[D7]usic d[G]ied[C], I[G] started singin'

So [G]bye, [C]bye Miss [G]American [D]Pie
Drove my [G]Chevy to the [C]levy but the [G]levy was [D]dry
And them [G]good old [C]boys were drinkin' [G]whiskey and [D]rye
Singin' [Em*]this will be the day that I [A7*]die, t[Em*]his will be the day that I d[D7]ie

Now for t[G]en years we've been [Am]on our own,
and mo[C]ss grows fat on a ro[Am]lling stone [Em]but that's not how it u[D]sed to be
When the j[G]ester [D/F#]sang for the kin[Em]g and queen
in a [Am7]coat he borrowed fr[C]om James Dean in a v[Em]oice that came [A7]from you and[D] me
And w[Em*]hile the king was lo[D*]oking down, the j[Em*]ester stole his thor[D*]ny crown
The c[C]ourtroom [G]was adjourn[A7]ed, no[C] verdict was r[D7]eturned
And while [G]Lenin rea[D/F#]d a bo[Em]ok on Marx, the[Am] quartet prac[C]ticed in the park
And [G]we sang d[D/F#]irges i[Em]n the dark the [C]day the mu[D7]sic die[G]d, [C]we [G]were singin'

So [G]bye, [C]bye Miss [G]American [D]Pie
Drove my [G]Chevy to the [C]levy but the [G]levy was [D]dry
And them [G]good old [C]boys were drinkin' [G]whiskey and [D]rye
Singin' [Em*]this will be the day that I [A7*]die, t[Em*]his will be the day that I d[D7]ie

[G]Helter skelter in a [Am]summer swelter
[C]the birds flew off with[Am] a fallout shelter,[Em] eight miles high and f[D]allin' fast
It lan[G]ded [D/F#]foul o[Em]n the grass
the pl[Am7]ayers tried for a f[C]orward pass, [Em]with the jester on the sideline[A7]s in a [D]cast
Now at ha[Em*]lftime there was s[D*]weet perfume, while [Em*]sergeants played a m[D*]arching tune
[C]We all got [G]up to dan[A7]ce, but [C]we never got the ch[D7]ance
'Cuz the p[G]layers [D/F#]tried to t[Em]ake the field, the [Am]marching band re[C]fused to yield
Do y[G]ou re[D/F#]call what w[Em]as the feel the [C]day the m[D7]usic died[G],  [C]  w[G]e started singin'

So [G]bye, [C]bye Miss [G]American [D]Pie
Drove my [G]Chevy to the [C]levy but the [G]levy was [D]dry
And them [G]good old [C]boys were drinkin' [G]whiskey and [D]rye
Singin' [Em*]this will be the day that I [A7*]die, t[Em*]his will be the day that I d[D7]ie

And t[G]here we were all [Am]in one place,
a ge[C]neration [Am]lost in space,[Em] with no time left to[D] start again
So come on J[G]ack be [D/F#]nimble,[Em] Jack be quick, J[Am7]ack Flash sat on a c[C]andle
stick, [Em]'cuz fire is the devi[A7]l's only friend[D] 
And a[Em*]s I watched him o[D*]n the stage, my h[Em*]ands were clenched in f[D*]ists of rage
No [C]angel b[G]orn in H[A7]ell could b[C]reak that Satan's s[D7]pell
And as the [G]flames climbe[D/F#]d high int[Em]o the night to [Am]light the sacrif[C]icial rite
I saw S[G]atan[D/F#] laughing with [Em]delight the d[C]ay the [D7]music di[G]ed,[C]   [G]  he was singin'

So [G]bye, [C]bye Miss [G]American [D]Pie
Drove my [G]Chevy to the [C]levy but the [G]levy was [D]dry
And them [G]good old [C]boys were drinkin' [G]whiskey and [D]rye
Singin' [Em*]this will be the day that I [A7*]die, t[Em*]his will be the day that I d[D7]ie

I [G]met a[D/F#] girl who s[Em]ang the blues
And I [Am]asked her for some [C]happy news, but [Em]she just smiled and turn[D]ed away
I [G]went dow[D/F#]n to the s[Em]acred store
Where I[Am]'d heard the mus[C]ic years before, but t[Em]he man there said t[C]he music
wouldn't [D]play
But [Em*]in the streets the [Am*]children screamed, the [Em*]lovers cried and the [Am*]poets dreamed
But [C]not a [G]word was [Am]spoken, the [C]church bells all were [D]broken
And the [G]three me[D/F#]n I adm[Em]ire most, the [Am7]Father, [C]Son, and the H[D7]oly Ghost
[G]They caught th[D/F#]e last train f[Em]or the coast the [Am7]day the [D7]music [G]died,
And they were singin'

So [G]bye, [C]bye Miss [G]American [D]Pie
Drove my [G]Chevy to the [C]levy but the [G]levy was [D]dry
And them [G]good old [C]boys were drinkin' [G]whiskey and [D]rye
Singin' [Em*]this will be the day that I [A7*]die, t[Em*]his will be the day that I d[D7]ie
So [G]bye, [C]bye Miss [G]American [D]Pie
Drove my [G]Chevy to the [C]levy but the [G]levy was [D]dry
And them [G]good old [C]boys were drinkin' [G]whiskey and [D]rye
Singin' [C]this will be the [D7]day that I [G]die.[C]    [G]
