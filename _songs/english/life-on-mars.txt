[F]It's a g[Am]od-awful small affair       [Cm/Eb]     
To the girl[D7] with the mousy hair
[Gm]   But her [Bb]mummy is yelling "No"              [C7]  
And her daddy has told her to go               [F] 
[F]But her [Am]friend is nowhere to be seen[Cm/Eb]     
Now she wal[D7]ks through her sunken dream.
[Gm]To the seat[Bb] with the clearest view            [C7]  

And she's hooked to the silver screen

[Ab]But the f[Eaug]ilm is a saddening bore           [Fm]  
For she's live[G#7]d it ten times or more
[C#]She could spi[Aaug]t in the eyes of fools         [Bbm]   
As they ask h[C#7]er to focus on

[Bb]Sailors fig[Eb]hting in the dance hall
[Gm7]Oh man! lo[F#aug]ok at those cavemen go         [F] 
[Fm]It's the freakiest show [Cm7]   
[Ebm7]Take a look at the lawma[Bb]n 
[Eb]Beating up the wrong guy
[Gm]Oh man! Won[F#aug]der if he'll ever know
[F]   [Fm]He's in the best selling show         [Cm7]   
[Ebm7]Is there life on Ma[Gm7]rs?       [F#aug]        [Bb]     [C/E]   

[F](bri[F#dim]dge)  [Gm]    [Ddim]     [Am]   [Bb]    [Bbm]   

[F]It's on [Am]Amerika's tortured brow     [Cm/Eb]     
That Mickey[D7] Mouse has grown up a cow
[Gm]Now the wor[Bb]kers have struck for fame          [C7]  
'Cause Lennon's on sale again                  [F] 
[F]See the [Am]mice in their million hordes[Cm/Eb]     
From Ibeza [D7]to the norfolk broads
[Gm]Rule Britan[Bb]nia is out of bounds               [C7]  
To my mother, my dog, and clowns                [F] 

[Ab]But the f[Eaug]ilm is a saddening bore           [Fm]  
For I've writ [G#7]it ten times or more
[C#]It's about to[Aaug] be writ again                 [Bbm]   
As I ask you [C#7]to focus on

[Bb]Sailors fig[Eb]hting in the dance hall
[Gm7]Oh man! lo[F#aug]ok at those cavemen go         [F] 
[Fm]It's the freakiest show [Cm7]   
[Ebm7]Take a look at the lawma[Bb]n 
[Eb]Beating up the wrong guy
[Gm]Oh man! Won[F#aug]der if he'll ever know
[F]   [Fm]He's in the best selling show         [Cm7]   
[Ebm7]Is there life on Ma[Gm7]rs?       [F#aug]        [Bb]
