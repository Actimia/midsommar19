[G]Wake up you [D]sleepy head
[Esus4]Put on some clothes shake [Em]off your bed
[G]Put another log on the [D]fire for me
[A]I've made some breakfast and [E]coffee
[G]Look out my window, [D]what do I see
A [B7]crack in the sky and a [Em]hand reaching [F]down to [C]me
All the [A7]nightmares came to[D]day
And it looks as though they're h[G]ere to[Adim/C#] stay   [D]  [Bdim/D#]        [E]  [B/F#]     [F#sus4]       [F#]  
[G]What are we [D]coming to
[Esus4]No room for me no [Em]fun for you
[G]I think about a [D]world to come
Where the [A]books were found by the [E]Golden Ones
[G]Written in pain [D]written in awe
By a [B7]puzzled man who [Em]questioned what we [C]were here for
All the [A7]strangers came to[D]day
And it looks as though they're [G]here to stay

[G]Oh you [Bm]pretty things [Em]  
Don't you [D]know you're driving your [C7]mamas and papas insa[G]ne?
[G]Oh you [Bm]pretty things [Em]  
Don't you [D]know you're driving your [C7]mamas and papas insa[G]ne?
Let me [A]make it plain
[D]Gotta make way for the [C]homo superio[G]r

Look out at [D]your children
[Esus4]See their faces in [Em]golden rays
[G]Don't kid yourself they [D]belong to you
[A]They're the start of the [E]coming race
[G]The earth is a bitch
[D]We've finished our news
[B7]Homo sapiens [Em]have out[F]grown their [C]use
All the [A7]strangers came [D]today and it looks as though they're [G]here to stay
