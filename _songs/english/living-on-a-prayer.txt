So t[C]ough,  [D]    it's so t[Em]ough.
[Em]Gina dreams of running away, when she cries in the night, Tommy whispers:
Baby its O.[C]K,    [D]   some d[Em]ay.

We’ve got to h[C]old   [D]on to   what we'[Em]ve got.

We've g[C]ot each o[D]ther and that's a[Em] lot, for l[C]ove.
We'll [D]give it a shot.
