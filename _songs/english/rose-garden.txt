[C]I beg your [Dm]pardon..[G7]I never promised you a [C]rose garden.
Along with the [Dm]sunshine..[G7]there's gotta be a little
[C]rain, sometimes.

When you [F]take you got to give, so, live and let
live, or let [Dm]go..whoa..whoa..whoa..whoa..
I beg your [G7]pardon..I never promised you a [C]rose garden.

[C]I could promise you things like big diamond rings,
but you don't find roses growing on stalks of [Dm]clover..
so, you better think it [G7]over.
Well, if [C]sweet talking you could make it come true
I would give you the world right now on a silver [Dm]platter..
but what would it [G7]matter?

So, [Dm]smile for a while and [G7]let's be jolly, [Gm]love shouldn't
be so [A]melan[A7]choly..
[Dm]come along and share the good times while we [F]can..[G7]an..

[G7]I beg your [Dm]pardon..[G7]I never promised you a [C]rose garden.
Along with the [Dm]sunshine..[G7]there's gotta be a little
[C]rain, sometimes.

[G7]I beg your [Dm]pardon..[G7]I never promised you a [C]rose garden.

[C]I could sing you a tune and promise you the moon..

but if that's what it takes to hold you,
I'd just as soon [Dm]let you go.
But there's one thing I [G7]want you to know.
You better [C]look before you leap, still waters run deep,
and there won't always be someone there to [Dm]pull you out..
and you know what I'm [G7]talking about..

So, [Dm]smile for a while and [G7]let's be jolly, [Gm]love shouldn't
be so [A]melan[A7]choly..
[Dm]come along and share the good times while we [F]can..[G7]an..

[G7]I beg your [Dm]pardon..[G7]I never promised you a [C]rose garden.
Along with the [Dm]sunshine..[G7]there's gotta be a little
[C]rain, sometimes.

[G7]I beg your [Dm]pardon..[G7]I never promised you a [C]rose garden...(Fade.)
