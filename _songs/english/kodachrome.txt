When I think [D]back
on all the [D7]crap I learned in [G]high school
[Em]It's a wonder
[A7]I can think at [D]all[Em]   [A7]  
And though my [D]lack of edu[D7]cation
hasn't [G]hurt me none
[Em]I can read the [A]writing on the [D]wall[D7]  

Koda[G]ch[B7]rom[E]e
You [E7]give us those [Am]nice bright [D]colors
You give us the [G]greens of [C]summers
Makes you [A]think all the [D]world's a sunny [G]day, [B7]oh [E]yeah!
[E7]I got a [Am]Nikon [D]camera
I love to take a [G]photo[C]graph
So Mama, don't [A]take my [D]Kodachrome a[G]way [G]  [Bm]   [Em]   [A]  [A7]  

If you took [D]all the girls I [D7]knew
when I was [G]single
And [Em]brought them all to[A7]gether for one [D]night[Em]   [A7]  
I know they'd [D]never match
my [D7]sweet imagi[G]nation
[Em]And everything looks [A]worse in [A7]black and [D]white[D7]
