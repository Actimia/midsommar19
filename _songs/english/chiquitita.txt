[A]Chiquitita, tell me what's wrong.
You're enchained by [E]your own sorrow.
[D]In your [E]eyes there is [E7]no hope for to[A]morrow.
How I hate to see you like this,
there is no way [C#m]you can deny it,
[E]I [D]can [E]see that you're [E7]oh, so [A]sad, so quiet.

[A]Chiquitita, tell me the truth.
I'm a shoulder [E]you can cry on.
[D]Your best [E]friend, I'm the [E7]one you must [A]rely on.
You were always sure of yourself.
Now I see you've [C#m]broken a feather.
[E]I [D]hope [E]we can [E7]patch it up to..[A]gether.

[A]Chiquitita, you and I [D]know,
How the heartaches come and they go
and the [A]scars they're leaving.
You'll be dancing once a[E]gain and the [D]pain will [E]end,
You will [E7]have no [A]time for grieving.
Chiquitita, you and I [D]cry,
But the sun is still in the sky and [A]shining above you.
Let me hear you sing once [E]more, like you [D]did be[E]fore,
Sing a [E7]new song, [A]Chiquitita....
[E]Try, once more, like you [D]did be[E]fore,
Sing a [E7]new song, [A]Chiquitita.

[A]So the walls came tumbling down.
And your love's a [E]blown out candle.
[D]All is [E]gone and it [E7]seems too [A]hard to handle.

Chiquitita, tell me the truth.
There is no way [C#m]you can deny it.
[E]I [D]see that you're [E]oh, [E7]so sad, so [A]quiet.

[A]Chiquitita, you and I [D]know,
How the heartaches come and they go
and the [A]scars they're leaving.
You'll be dancing once a[E]gain and the [D]pain will [E]end,
You will [E7]have no [A]time for grieving.
Chiquitita, you and I [D]cry,
But the sun is still in the sky and [A]shining above you.
Let me hear you sing once [E]more, like you [D]did be[E]fore,
Sing a [E7]new song, [A]Chiquitita....
[E]Try, once more, like you [D]did be[E]fore,
Sing a [E7]new song, [A]Chiquitita.
