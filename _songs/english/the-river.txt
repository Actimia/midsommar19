I [Em]come from down in the [G]valley
Where [D]mister when you're [C]young
They [Em]bring you up to [G]do [C]like your daddy [G]done
Me and [C]Mary we met in high school
When [G]she was just [D]seven[Em]teen
We'd [Am]drive out of this valley down to [G]where the fields were [C]green

We'd go [Em]down to the [C]river
And [D]into the river we'd [G]dive
Oh [Em]down to the [C]river we'd [D]ri[C]de

Then [Em]I got Mary [G]pregnant
And [D]man that was all she [C]wrote
And [Em]for my nineteenth [G]birthday I got a union [C]card and a wedding [G]coat
We [C]went down to the courthouse
And the [G]judge put it [D]all to [Em]rest
No [Am]wedding day smiles, no walk down the aisle
No [G]flowers, no wedding [C]dress

That night we went [Em]down to the [C]river
And [D]into the river we'd [G]dive
Oh [Em]down to the [C]river we did [D]ri[C]de

I [Em]got a job working con[G]struction for the [D]Johnstown Compa[C]ny
But [Em]lately there ain't been [G]much work on ac[C]count of the econo[G]my
Now [C]all them things that seemed so important
Well mister they [G]vanished right [D]into the [Em]air
Now I just [Am]act like I don't remember
Mary [G]acts like she don't [C]care

But I re[Em]member us riding in my [G]brother's car
Her body [D]tan and wet down at the [C]reservoir
At [Em]night on them banks I'd [G]lie awake
And pull her [C]close just to feel each [G]breath she'd take
Now those [C]memories come back to haunt me
They [G]haunt me [D]like a [Em]curse
Is a [Am]dream a lie if it don't come true
Or [G]is it something [C]worse,

That sends me [Em]down to the [C]river
Though I [D]know the river is [G]dry
That sends me [Em]down to the [C]river to[D]ni[C]ght
[Em]Down to the [C]river
My [D]baby and [G]I
Oh [Em]down to the [C]river we [D]ri[C]de
