[C]  [Am7]    [Dm7]    [G7sus]     

[C]Got a wife and kids in [Am7]Baltimore Jack
I went [Dm7]out for a ride and I [G7sus]never went back
[C]Like a river that don't [Am7]know where it's flowing
[Dm7]I took a wrong turn and I [G7sus]just kept going
[C]Everybody's got a [Am7]hungry heart
[Dm7]Everybody's got a [G7sus]hungry heart
[C]Lay down your money and you [Am7]play your part
[Dm7]Everybody's got a [G7sus]huh-uh-un-gry heart

[C]I met her in a [Am7]Kingstown bar
[Dm7]We fell in love I knew [G7sus]it had to end
[C]We took what we had and we [Am7]ripped it apart
[Dm7]Now here I am down in [G7sus]Kingstown again
[C]Everybody's got a [Am7]hungry heart
[Dm7]Everybody's got a [G7sus]hungry heart
[C]Lay down your money and you [Am7]play your part
[Dm7]Everybody's got a [G7sus]huh-uh-un-gry heart

(rest of song continues just like the verses before it)

Everybody needs a place to rest
Everybody wants to have a home
Don't make no difference what nobody says
Ain't nobody like to be alone

Everybody's got a hungry heart...
