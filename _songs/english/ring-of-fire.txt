[G]Love Is A [C]Burning [G]Thing
And It Makes A [D]Fiery [G]Ring
Bound By [C]Wild [G]Desire
I Fell Into A [D]Ring Of [G]Fire

[D]I Fell Into A [C]Burning Ring Of [G]Fire
I Went [D]Down, Down, Down
And The [C]Flames Went [G]Higher

And It Burns, Burns, Burns
The [C]Ring Of [G]Fire
The [D]Ring Of[G] Fire

The Taste Of [C]Love Is [G]Sweet
When Hearts Like [D]Ours [G]Meet

Ohh, But The [D]Fire Went [G]Wild
