I was [E]totin' my pack along the long dusty Winnemucca road,
When along came a semi with a high an' canvas-covered load.
"If you're [A]goin' to Winnemucca, Mack, with me you can ride."
And so I [E]climbed into the cab and then I settled down inside.
He [B7]asked me if I'd seen a road with so much dust and sand.
And I said, "[E]Listen, I've traveled every road in this here land!"

[E]I've been everywhere, man.
I've been everywhere, man.
[A]Crossed the deserts bare, man.
I've [E]breathed the mountain air, man.
