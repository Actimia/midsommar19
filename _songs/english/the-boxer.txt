[C]I am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom to[Am]ld
I have squa[G]ndered my resistance
For a pocketful of mum[C]bles such are promises
All lies and [Am]jest still a m[G]an hears what he wa[F]nts to hear
And disregards the r[C]est    [G]     [C] 

When I left my home and family I was no more than a b[Am]oy
In the co[G]mpany of strangers
In the q[Dm7]uiet of a r[C]ailway station running scared
Laying [Am]low seeking o[G]ut the poorer qua[F]rters where the ragged people[C] go
Looking f[G]or the places o[F]nly t[Em]hey w[Dm]ould k[C]now

Lie-la-l[Am]ie
Lie-la-l[G]ie la lie-la-lie
Lie la l[Am]ie
[G]Lie-la-lie la la la la l[F]ie la la la [G]la l[C]ie

Asking only workmans wages I come looking for a j[Am]ob
But I get no off[G]ers
Just a co[Dm7]me-on from the wh[C]ores on seventh avenue
I do dec[Am]lare there were tim[Dm7]es when [G]I was [F]so lonesome I took some comfort th[C]ere

Ooo-la-l[G]a la la la la   [C] 

Lie-la-l[Am]ie
Lie-la-l[G]ie la lie-la-lie
Lie la l[Am]ie
[G]Lie-la-lie la la la la l[F]ie la la la [G]la l[C]ie

[C]Then I'm laying out my winter clothes
[G7]And [C]wishing I was g[Am]one
Going h[G]ome where the [Dm7]New York [G7]City winters aren[G]'t [C]bleeding me
Leading me  [Am]  
Going Ho[G]me

In the [C]clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his [Am]trade
And he car[G]ries the reminders
Of e[G7]v'ry glove that l[C]aid him down or cut him '[Dm7]till he [G7]cried out [C] 
In his anger and his sha[Am]me
"I am Le[G]aving, I am Lea[F]ving."  But the Fighter still r[C]emains  [G]  [C]   [G]       [F]       [C] 

Lie-la-l[Am]ie
Lie-la-l[G]ie la lie-la-lie
Lie la l[Am]ie
L[G]ie-la-lie la la la la lie[F] la la la la l[Am]ie
