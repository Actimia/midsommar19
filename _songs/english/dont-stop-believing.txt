[C/G]Just a [G]small town girl[Am], living in a [F]lonely world
[C/G]She took the [G]midnight train going [Em]anywh[F]ere

[C/G]Just a [G]city boy[Am], born and raised in [F]south Detroit
[C/G]He took the [G]midnight train going [Em]anywh[F]ere

[C/G]A singer in a [G]smoky room[Am], a smell of wine and [F]cheap perfume
[C/G]For a smile they can [G]share the night, it goes [Em]on and on and [F]on and on

[G]Stran[F]gers [G]wai[Am]ting [F]up and down the [G]boulevard
Their [G]sha[F]dows [G]sear[Am]ching in the [G]nig[F]ht
[G]Street[F]light, [G]peo[Am]ple, [F]living just to [G]find emotion
[G]Hi[F]ding, [G]some[Am]where in the [G]night

[C/G]Working hard to [G]get my fill[Am], everybody [F]wants a thrill
[C/G]Paying anything to [G]roll the dice, just [Em]one more [F]time

[C/G]Some will win, [G]some will lose[Am], some were born to [F]sing the blues
[C/G]Oh, the movie [G]never ends; it goes [Em]on and on and [F]on and on

[G]Stran[F]gers [G]wai[Am]ting [F]up and down the [G]boulevard
Their [G]sha[F]dows [G]sear[Am]ching in the [G]nig[F]ht
[G]Street[F]light, [G]peo[Am]ple, [F]living just to [G]find emotion
[G]Hi[F]ding, [G]some[Am]where in the [G]night
