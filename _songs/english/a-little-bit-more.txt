Wh[G]en your body's had [Gmaj7]enough of me,
and I'm [C]layin' flat out on the [Am]floor,
when you [Cm]think I've loved you [G]all I can,
I'm gonna [D]love you a [D7]little bit [G]more[D].

C[G]ome on over here and [C]lay by my side,
I[Am]'ve got to be [D]touchin' [G]you,
[B7]let me rub your tired [Em]shoulders the way I [A]used to [D]do.
L[G]ook into my eyes and [C]give me that smile,
t[Am]he one that always [D]turns me [G]on,
a[B7]nd let me take your [Em]hair down'cause we're [A]stayin' up to greet the [D]sun.

Wh[G]en your body's had [Gmaj7]enough of me,
and I'm [C]layin' flat out on the [Am]floor,
when you [Cm]think I've loved you [G]all I can,
I'm gonna [D]love you a [D7]little bit [G]more[D].

[G]Got to say a few things [C]that have been on my mind,
[Am]and you know where my[D] mind has[G] been,
[B7]I guess I learned my [Em]lessons, and [A]now's the time to [D]begin.
[G]So if you're feelin alright and [C]you're ready for me,
[Am]I know that I'm [D]ready for [G]you,
[B7]we better get it [Em]on now, 'cause we [A]got a whole [D]life to live [D7]through.

Wh[G]en your body's had [Gmaj7]enough of me,
and I'm [C]layin' flat out on the [Am]floor,
when you [Cm]think I've loved you [G]all I can,
I'm gonna [D]love you a [D7]little bit [G]more[D].
