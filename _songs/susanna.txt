[Am]   We sit to-ge[Em]ther on the so[Am]fa    [Em]  
   With the music way down low
   I waited so long for this moment
   It's hard to think it's really so

[Dm]The doo[Dm/E]r is lock[F9]ed there's no on[Am]e home [G] 

[Dm]They've[Dm/E] all gone[F9] out we're all a[Am]-lone  [G] 

[Am]Su-sanna, [Em]- - - [Am]Su-sann[Em]a 
[Am]Su-sann[Em]a I'm craz[Am]y loving yo[Em]u 

[Am]I put my arm ar[Em]oud her should[Am]er    [Em]  
Run my fingers through her hair
It's a dream I can't believe it
It took so long it's only fair

[Dm]Then sh[Dm/E]e says co[F9]uld we just sit [Am]and cha[G]t
[Dm]And I t[Dm/E]hink well[F9] that's that    [Am]       [G]

Su-sanna, I'm crazy loving you
Su-sanna, - - - Su-sanna,
Su-sanna, I'm crazy loving you

I'm so crazy loving you
