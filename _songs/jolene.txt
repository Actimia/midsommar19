J[Am]olene, Jo[C]lene, Jo[G]lene, Jo[Am]lene
I`m b[G]egging of you please dont`t take my [Am]man
Jo[Am]lene, Jo[C]lene, Jo[G]lene, J[Am]olene
Ple[G]ase don`t take him j[Em]ust because you c[Am]an

Your be[Am]auty is be[C]yond compare
With fl[G]aming locks of au[Am]burn hair
With iv[G]ory skin and e[Em]yes of emerald g[Am]reen
Your sm[Am]ile is like a b[C]reath of spring
Your vo[G]ice is soft like su[Am]mmer rain
And i c[G]annot comp[Em]ete with you, J[Am]olene

He t[Am]alks about you [C]in his sleep
There[G]`s nothing i can [Am]do to keep
From [G]crying when he c[Em]alls your name, J[Am]olene
And [Am]i can easily u[C]nderstand
How [G]you could easily t[Am]ake my man
But [G]you don`t know w[Em]hat he means to me, J[Am]olene

Jo[Am]lene, Jo[C]lene, Jo[G]lene, Jo[Am]lene
I`m be[G]gging of you please don`t take my[Am] man
Jo[Am]lene, Jo[C]lene, Jo[G]lene, Jo[Am]lene
Pl[G]ease don`t take him j[Em]ust because you[Am] can

you[Am] could have your[C] choice of men
But [G]i could never l[Am]ove again
He`s[G] the only on[Em]e for me, Jo[Am]lene
I h[Am]ad to have this t[C]alk with you
My [G]happines depe[Am]nds on you
Wha[G]tever you dec[Em]ide to do, Jo[Am]lene

Jo[Am]lene, Jo[C]lene, Jo[G]lene, Jo[Am]lene
I`m be[G]gging of you please don`t take my[Am] man
Jo[Am]lene, Jo[C]lene, Jo[G]lene, Jo[Am]lene
Pl[G]ease don`t take him e[Em]ven though you [Am]can
