[G]Got on a [Am]board a west bound [D]seven forty [G]seven
Didn't [Am]think before de[D]ciding what to [G]do
All that [Am]talk of oppor[D]tunities, [G]TV breaks and [Em]movies
Rang [Am]true[D], sure rang [G]true.

Seems it [Am]never rain in [D]Southern Cali[G]forni[Em]a 
Seems I've [Am]often heard that [D]kind of talk be[G]fore[Em]  
It never [Am]rains in Cali[D]fornia
But [G]girls, don't they [Em]warn ya
It [Am]pours[D] man it [G]pours.

Out of [Am]work, I'm out of my [D]head
Out of self res[G]pect I'm out of bread
I'm under [Am]loved I'm under [D]fed
I wanna go [G]home
It never [Am]rains in Cali[D]fornia
But [G]girls, don't they [Em]warn ya
It [Am]pours[D] man it [G]pours.

Will you [Am]tell the folks back [D]home I nearly [G]made it
Had [Am]offers but don't [D]know which one to [G]take
Please don't [Am]tell them how you [D]found me
Don't [G]tell them how you found me give me a break
Give me a [Am]brea[D]k, give me a [G]break

Seems it [Am]never rain in [D]Southern Cali[G]forni[Em]a 
Seems I've [Am]often heard that [D]kind of talk be[G]fore[Em]  
It never [Am]rains in Cali[D]fornia
But [G]girls, don't they [Em]warn ya
It [Am]pours[D] man it [G]pours.
