[Bm]On a dark desert highway, [F#]cool wind in my hair
[A]Warm smell of colitas [E]rising up through the air
[G]Up ahead in the distance, [D]I saw a shimmering light
[Em]My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
[F#]I had to stop for the night

[Bm]There she stood in the doorway;  [F#]I heard the mission bell
[A]And I was thinking to myself this could be [E]heaven or this could be hell
[G]Then she lit up a candle,[D] and she showed me the way
[Em]There were voices down the corridor, [F#]I thought I heard them say

[G]Welcome to the Hotel Cali[D]fornia.
Such a [F#7]lovely place, such a l[Bm]ovely face
[G]Plenty of room at the Hotel Cali[D]fornia
[Em]Any time of year (any time of year) you [F#]can find it here

[Bm]Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, [F#]she got the Mercedes bends
[A]She got a lot of pretty, [E]pretty boys she calls friends
[G]How they dance in the courtyard, [D]sweet summer sweat.
[Em]Some dance to remember, so[F#]me dance to forget

[Bm]So I called up the Captain, '[F#]Please bring me my wine'
[A]He said, 'We haven't had that spirit here since [E]nineteen sixty nine'
[G]And still those voices are [D]calling from far away,
[Em]Wake you up in the middle of the night
[F#]Just to hear them say...

[G]Welcome to the Hotel Cali[D]fornia
[F#7]Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place), Such a [Bm]lovely face
[G]They livin' it up at the Hotel Cali[D]fornia
[Em]What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise), [F#]Bring your alibis

[Bm]Mirrors on the ceiling, [F#]The pink champagne on ice
[A]And she said 'We are all just prisoners here, [E]of our own device'
[G]And in the master's chambers, [D]They gathered for the feast
[Em]They stab it with their steely knives,
[F#]But they just can't kill the beast

[Bm]Last thing I remember, [F#]I was running for the door
[A]I had to find the passage back to the [E]place I was before
[G]'Relax,' said the night man, '[D]We are programmed to receive.
[Em]You can check-out any time you like,
[F#]But you can never leave!'
