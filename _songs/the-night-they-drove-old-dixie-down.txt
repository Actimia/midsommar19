[Em]Virgil K[G]ane is the name
And I se[C]rved on the Danville t[Am]rain
'T[Em]ill Stoneman's cav[G]alry came
And to[C]re up the tracks ag[Am]ain

[Em]In the winter of '[C]65
We were hu[G]ngry, just bar[Am]ely alive
By [Em]May the 10th, Ri[C]chmond had fell
I[G]t's a time I reme[Em]mber, oh so w[A]ell

The ni[G]ght they dro[C]ve old Dixie do[G]wn
And the b[Em]ells were ringing
The nig[G]ht they d[C]rove old Dixie do[G]wn
And the pe[Em]ople were singing
They went, "[G]Na Na Na Na [Em]Na Na Na N[A]a Na Na Na Na [C]Na Na Na Na

B[Em]ack with my wife in Ten[G]nessee
When o[C]ne day she called to[Am] me
"Vi[Em]rgil, quick, c[G]ome see,
Th[C]ere goes Robert E. L[Am]ee!"
Now, I d[Em]on't mind cho[C]pping wood
And I d[G]on't care if the mon[Am]ey's no good
You t[Em]ake what you need And you l[C]eave the rest
But they should n[G]ever Have ta[Em]ken the very b[A]est

The ni[G]ght they dr[C]ove old Dixie do[G]wn
And the be[Em]lls were ringing
The ni[G]ght they drove old Dixie do[G]wn
And all the pe[Em]ople were singing
They went, [G]Na Na Na Na [Em]Na Na Na N[A]a Na Na Na Na [C]Na Na Na Na

[Em]Like my father before[G] me I [C]will work the lan[Am]d 
[Em]And like my brother a[G]bove me [C]Who took a rebel stand
He was just 18, pro[C]ud and brave
But a Ya[G]nkee laid him [Am]in his grave
[Em]I swear by the mud be[C]low my feet
You can't ra[G]ise a Kane back u[Em]p When he's in de[A]feat

The ni[G]ght they dr[C]ove old Dixie do[G]wn
And the be[Em]lls were ringing
The ni[G]ght they drove old Dixie do[G]wn
And all the pe[Em]ople were singing
They went, [G]Na Na Na Na [Em]Na Na Na N[A]a Na Na Na Na [C]Na Na Na Na

The n[G]ight they d[C]rove old Dixie d[G]own
And the be[Em]lls were ringing
The ni[G]ght they drove old Dixie do[G]wn
And all the pe[Em]ople were singing
